This simulation is under construction.  It will reproduce 
the model of a Kenyon cell originally developed and 
published by:

Pelz, C., Jander, J., Rosenboom, H., Hammer, M. and Menzel, R. 
(1999)  IA in Kenyon cells of the mushroom body of honeybees
resembles shaker currents: kinetics, modulation by K+, and
simulation.  J. Neurophysiol.  81: 1749-1759.

Example use:

Start SNNAP (double click on the SNNAP.jar file)
click on "Run Simulation"
Then in the new window "File"->"Load Simulation"
browse to and load Kenyon_Ka_VC.smu file to load a simulation
then and click "Run Batch" and open Ka_VC.bch to generate
a figure similar to Fig 12 in the above publication
(see Fig12Model.jpg for what it should look like when done).
